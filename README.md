# Order Taking Form Application Project 📓

Welcome to Bonnie's Balloons Order Taking Project Repository! This project showcases a C# application developed in Visual Studio to automate the balloon order process for Bonnie's Balloons, a fictional small privately-owned balloon shop. The program aims to replace the current paper-based system with an efficient and user-friendly digital solution. For a quick overview, check out the 1-minute demo video located in the Demo folder as an mp4 file.

This short project demonstrates various programming concepts such as variable and constant declaration, event handlers, exception handling, file I/O, loops, custom methods, conditional statements, and more. If you're interested in exploring the full codebase, you can download the zipped file containing the entire project.
